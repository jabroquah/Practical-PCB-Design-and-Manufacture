# ECEN 3730 & 5730 - Practical PCB Design, Fall 2025 Session.

## Reports for ECEN 5730:

#### Board 1  
A PCB design of an astable 555-timer oscillator generating a 500 Hz square wave with a 60% duty cycle. 

#### Board 2  
A lab session demonstrating best measurement practices for switching-noise characterization and how layout decisions affect switching noise in a PCB.

#### Board 3
Implementation of best design practices to create a “Golden Arduino Board” with lower noise than a commercial Arduino board.

### Lab2
A solderless breadboard implementation of a 555 timer.

### Lab5
Demonstration of switching noise in the power path and how decoupling-capacitor placement and value influence noise levels.

### Lab 11 & 12
Measurement of trace resistance using 2-wire and 4-wire methods.

### Lab 15
Performance comparison of three identical circuits designed with different layout rules.

### Lab 16
Comparison of analog signal measurements from a temperature sensor using single-ended versus differential-pair measurement techniques.

### Lab 18
In-rush current measurement.

### Lab 21 & 22 
Construction of a solderless-breadboard “instrument droid” used to characterize any voltage source by measuring Thevenin voltage and Thevenin resistance as a function of output current.
